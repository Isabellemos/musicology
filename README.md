MY CORPUS 

I will be investigating the songs of the famous duo Bicep and compare this to the song of Stephan Bodzin. Both Bicep and Bodzin are an electronic artists and have a very different but characteristic style. A fan can immediately recognize a Bicep / Stephan Bodzin song. 

Bodzins songs typically have a baseline driven, emotive and hypnotic synth. 

Biceps songs have an immediately recognisable shuffling beat, subtle bass and soaring vocals are a surefire way to get any rave absolutely heaving.

However these artists have a very different electornic style, I think these artists are one of my all time favourites and I will never bore me. Therefore I am wondering if there are any simmilarities between the artists to figure out what makes me love them.


My corpus consists of the 'This is Bicep' playlist on spotify and the 'This is Stephan Bodzin' playlist.
