MY CORPUS 

My corpus consists of the following songs. I chose songs from my personal 'Techno' playlist on Spotify. 

Even tough these songs all belong to the techno genre, they all give me a very different feeling when I listen to them. For example, some of them make me want to dance and others make me relaxed.

During this course I would like to analyse what causes these songs such a different feeling by using the Spotify API to 'encode' each song.  

- Walking - Anyma
- Attention seeker - Josh Gigante 
- Reveries - Mind Against 
- Dahlia - Bicep, Hammer
- Human - Sevdaliza
- Patci - DJ T. 
- Obnoxious desire - Colyn, Innellea 
- Der Buhold - Paul Kalkbrenner 
- Changes - Mind Against 
- No war - Ry X Remix 


All songs in my corpus are somewhat 'elecronic', most of them techno. However there is still a lot of variety;
