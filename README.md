MY CORPUS 

I will be investigating the songs of the famous duo Bicep. Bicep are an electronic music production and DJ duo. They have released two albums, however ‘Glue’ by Bicep is an undeniable classic. The 4:45 dance hit is one of the best dance songs of all time, and its immediately recognisable shuffling beat, subtle bass and soaring vocals are a surefire way to get any rave absolutely heaving. It's an iconic song everyone immediately recognizes. 

For my musicology project I would like to research what makes Glue so outstanding and special. Therefore I will question the following:

'What is the difference between all Biceps' music and their signature song 'Glue', and what makes this song so recognisable, catchy and special? 

My corpus consists of the 'This is Bicep' playlist on spotify. I've started comparing this playlist to the glue song by making the following graphs: 


'Glue' song only:
