MY CORPUS 

Hi! For my corpus I'm still in doubt between 2 options however I think I will go for option 1!

Option 1: My corpus consists of all music of my favourite artist Sevdaliza. 

Sevdaliza started making music in 2015. Her genre is hard to identify I think. It is close to electronic / dance however I also feel Sevdaliza slightly changed her style / genre over the years as well. 

I would like to investigate in what way Sevdaliza's music changed over time (from 2015 to 2022) by comparing her songs split up in timeframes (I think I will divide songs in groups per year). 



=========


Option 2: My corpus consists of the following songs. I chose songs from my personal 'Techno' playlist on Spotify. 

Even tough these songs all belong to the techno genre, they all give me a very different feeling when I listen to them. For example, some of them make me want to dance and others make me relaxed.

During this course I would like to analyse what causes these songs such a different feeling by using the Spotify API to 'encode' each song.
